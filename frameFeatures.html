                <p>Every ZEAL sunglass is built for life outdoors. From the frame to the lens, each piece is designed to stand up to everyday life as well as the world's harshest conditions.</p>                

                <h4>Ultra Lightweight</h4>
                <p>The plant-based materials used in the construction of our frames contribute to a lighter finished weight than competitive products, making our sunglasses more comfortable for everyday wear and activity.</p>

                <h4>Proflex Rubber</h4>
                <p>This unique material is strategically injected into most of our frames to provide a soft and comfortable hold. ProFlex can withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures so your sunglasses stay in place no matter what the day brings.</p>                

                <h4>Hidden Spring Hinge</h4>
                <p>Innovative tooling and design has allowed us to place the spring hinge inside the body of the temple to improve fit and comfort.</p>
